  <strong><em>Pack Philosophy for Life</strong></em>

  <h2>The Key Pillars of Our Pack</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Respect: Everyone in the pack respects each other as well as the position they fulfill</li>
    <li>Trust: Everyone in the pack relies and counts on each other in all their doings.</li>
    <li>Love: Everyone in the pack looks out for each other and belongs to the pack family. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Our pack functions well, because we trust and respect each other. Trust and respect are the basis for a relationship filled with love. Achieve trust and respect, and love comes by itself

    <strong><em>Daily Success Formula</strong></em>

    <h2>Our Daily Formula for a Balanced Pack</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Excercize: We are hunters. We run. We search for food. To keep our body and mind healthy, we excerzise physically and mentaly</li>
        <li>Discziplin: Eventhough our hunts are very tiring. For the pack to be balanced, we need to practice disciplin. This is important for conditioning our mind and to maintain order during feeding time</li>
        <li>Affection: We need to have freetime too. After practicing excerzise and disciplin during our hunt and feeding, we enjoy ourselfs with lots of playing, cuddling, cleaning, and sleeping until the cascade starts over again</li>
    </ol>
